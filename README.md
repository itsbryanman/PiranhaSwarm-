##  Overview

**Pirana Swarm** is a revolutionary open-source intelligence (OSINT) platform that utilizes neural network enhancements to transform public data into actionable intelligence. Unlike traditional OSINT tools that focus on isolated data collection, Pirana Swarm employs a multi-vector approach with advanced correlation capabilities that outclass existing solutions.



> *"The most sophisticated intelligence platform available in the public domain"* ‚Äî Cybersecurity Today

##  Key Differentiators

- **Neural Network Enhanced**: Not just data collection - actual intelligence through advanced ML algorithms
- **Correlation Engine**: Automatically identifies non-obvious connections across disparate data sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns numerical reliability metrics to all intelligence gathered
- **Multi-Vector Approach**: Simultaneous collection from diverse sources for comprehensive target profiling
- **Adaptive Targeting**: AI-driven suggestions for new collection vectors based on discovered patterns

##  Primary Domain Focus: Total Target Profiling

Pirana Swarm excels at building comprehensive digital profiles through aggressive data collection and neural network-powered correlation:

- **Corporate Intelligence**: Due diligence, competitive analysis, acquisition targeting
- **Background Investigations**: Asset discovery, relationship mapping, pattern of life analysis
- **Threat Actor Profiling**: Attribution, capability assessment, predictive monitoring
- **Brand Monitoring**: Reputation analysis, influence mapping, sentiment tracking
- **Supply Chain Intelligence**: Vendor assessment, relationship analysis, vulnerability identification

##  The Killer Feature: Advanced Correlation Engine


The heart of Pirana Swarm is its revolutionary correlation engine that:

- **Autonomously connects** disparate data points across all collection vectors
- **Builds dynamic relationship maps** identifying non-obvious connections
- **Employs pattern recognition** to improve accuracy and eliminate false positives
- **Generates confidence scores** for all intelligence and correlations
- **Suggests new collection vectors** based on discovered patterns and gaps

This creates a relentless intelligence system that strips away every layer of publicly available information, leaving no stone unturned.

##  Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/itsbryanman/pirana-swarm.git

# Navigate to directory
cd pirana-swarm

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install optional GPU support
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt

# Run initial setup
python setup.py install
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

```python
from pirana_swarm import PiranaSwarm

# Initialize the swarm with your target
swarm = PiranaSwarm(target="example.com")

# Deploy all collection modules
swarm.deploy_all()

# Or select specific vectors
swarm.deploy(vectors=["social", "infrastructure", "documents"])

# Set confidence threshold
swarm.set_confidence_threshold(0.75)

# Generate intelligence report
report = swarm.generate_report(format="html")

# Export to visualization platforms
swarm.export(format="maltego")
```

##  Visualization Interface

Pirana Swarm includes a powerful web interface for intelligence visualization:

```bash
# Start the web interface
python -m pirana_swarm.ui --port 8080
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to access the full visualization suite.
